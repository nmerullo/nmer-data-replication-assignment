## Simulate Data of Child Study

There are four subgroups: black males, white males, black females, and white females.

Assume each distribution is normal and use rnorm()


```{r black-males}
set.seed(823)
cmb.age <- rnorm(113, mean = 14.09, sd = 2.62)
cmb.sys <- rnorm(113, mean = 111, sd = 11.637)
cmb.dia <- rnorm(113, mean = 67.31, sd = 10.867)
cmb.bmi <- rnorm(113, mean = 23.91, sd = 6.950)
```
